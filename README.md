Project Overview
This project predicts the presence of heart disease in patients using the Heart Disease UCI dataset. It implements a Medallion Architecture on MongoDB for layered data processing and develops machine learning classification models trained on refined data. A REST API built with FastAPI serves model predictions, which is deployed on Render for public access.
Dataset
Source: Heart Disease UCI Dataset on Kaggle


URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data


Description: Contains patient features such as age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, and a binary target indicating heart disease presence (0 = no, 1 = yes).



Medallion Architecture
Bronze Layer
Raw CSV data stored as JSON documents in MongoDB collection heart_disease_bronze.


No preprocessing applied at this stage.


Silver Layer
Handles missing values by imputing means for numerical and modes for categorical features.


Encodes categorical features numerically (label encoding or one-hot encoding).


Stored in heart_disease_silver collection.


Gold Layer
Normalizes numerical features using min-max scaling to range [0, 1].


Selects top features based on correlation and domain knowledge for model training.


Stored in heart_disease_gold collection.


Model Development
Used data from the Gold layer for training and testing.


Models trained: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM.


Final model chosen based on highest accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.


Feature selection based on correlation and feature importance from model outputs.


Hyperparameter tuning performed using Grid Search for optimal model performance.


Data split: 80% training, 20% testing.


Final model saved as a .pkl file using joblib for deployment.


REST API Development
Built with FastAPI to serve model predictions.


Endpoints:


POST /predict: Accepts JSON patient data and returns heart disease prediction.


GET /health: Returns status to verify API is running.


Includes input validation to ensure valid and complete feature data.


Loads the saved model for real-time prediction.


Deployment on Render
API deployed on Render with environment variables configured for MongoDB connection.


Publicly accessible URL: https://heart-disease-prediction-tpn4.onrender.com
API Documentation
Swagger UI available at /docs for interactive API exploration (FastAPI built-in).


Endpoint details:


POST /predict


Input: JSON with patient features (age, sex, cp, trestbps, chol, fbs, restecg, thalach, exang, oldpeak, slope, ca, thal).


Output: JSON with prediction (0 or 1).


GET /health


Returns HTTP 200 OK to indicate service is up.


Testing Using Postman
Setup POST request with JSON body to /predict.


Example JSON input:


json
CopyEdit
{
  "age": 60,
  "sex": 1,
  "cp": 0,
  "trestbps": 145,
  "chol": 233,
  "fbs": 1,
  "restecg": 0,
  "thalach": 150,
  "exang": 0,
  "oldpeak": 2.3,
  "slope": 0,
  "ca": 0,
  "thal": 1
}

Response example:


json
CopyEdit
{
  "prediction": 1
}

Health check GET request to /health returns HTTP status 200.


Screenshots of Postman requests and responses included in the screenshots/ directory.

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository.


      Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt


Setup MongoDB Atlas and get the connection string.


Configure environment variables for MongoDB URI in .env file or directly in the Render dashboard for deployment.
5. Run API locally:  uvicorn main:app --reload
Use Postman or Swagger UI to test endpoints locally.
